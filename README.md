# Train-time
I created a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host train data and updates information for the trains in real time.

Users can input the train's name, destination, frequency of travel and next arrival. 

Technologies used:

HTML
CSS
Javascript
jQuery
Bootstrap
Moment.js
Firebase
